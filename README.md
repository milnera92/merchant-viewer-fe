## SOME TOTALS ARE NOT DISPLAYING CORRECTLY, FIXING NOW 

## Merchant Dashboard
Backend is located here: https://github.com/milnera92/merchant-viewer-be. It is a PHP Server hosted on Heroku.
- Server: https://merchant-viewer.herokuapp.com/

## Overview
This project consists of a MySQL database containined merchant transaction information. The Database is hosted on AWS RDS, and is being accessed from a PHP server I have written and hosted on Heroku.
I have written a React front end to consume the JSON data being parsed from the PHP server, and displaying it as a "Merchant Portal" to view transactions.
The front end is hosted on both Render and Vercel (for testing purposes) but ther Render.com one is the version being publicly displayed.

## ToDo
- change TID, MID in SQL 
- ~~Style broke and do not have it fully back yet, needs work~~
- add merchant names, addresses, email address
- ~~add merchant and terminal totals~~
- format Readme correctly, it's a mess

## So Far....

- Started by created a MySQL Database hosted on Amazon Web Services RDS:

- Next, I went to MySQL Workbench and connect to the database. We will make a new schema, and start creating some tables:

- Seeding in some test data:

- Next I will start a new PHP project by running <code>composer init</code> in my working directory, along with phpdotenv. From there, I will create a .env file and add my AWS database login credentials as enviroment vaiables.

- Here I am accessing them in my PHP code.

- Note I am not importing Dotenv due to the .env key/value pairs being stored in Heroku settings.

- Get all data from all tables in database, and format it as a JSON response that will be consumable via fetch request from  React Front end:

- Let's take a look at the object we get in response to our GET request to the API:

- Here is the fetch request in React. After this, I map through the data:

- Now we can see the final result:

- Added functions for Merchant and Terminal totals:

- Finally add some formating, add some style, and the totals:
